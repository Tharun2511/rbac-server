# Project Overview

## 📖 Introduction
Restricted Access Based Control (RBAC) Server is a robust backend system designed to manage user authentication, authorization, and role-based access control. It serves as the core security layer for ensuring that users can only access resources permitted by their assigned roles.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js (Target: ES2020)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict Mode)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Raw SQL via `pg` driver)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Security**: BCrypt for password hashing
- **Development**: `ts-node-dev` for hot reloading

## 🎯 Core Objectives
1.  **Security First**: implementing strict authentication and authorization checks.
2.  **Scalability**: Modular architecture to support growing features.
3.  **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and strict typing.
4.  **Performance**: Efficient database queries and minimal overhead.
